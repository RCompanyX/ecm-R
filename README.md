<h2 align="center">External Custom Music Reloaded</h2>
<p align="center">A mod for Need for Speed: Underground 2 that plays custom music without overwriting the game's original files.</p>

## Overview

ECM-R replaces or mutes the in-game music and plays audio files from a user playlist folder.
It also includes an in-game overlay for basic playback control.

Current behavior in this fork is focused on **NFSU2**.

## Fork Status

This repository is maintained as a fork.
If you are looking for the original ECM source, attribution chain, or upstream history, review the upstream repository and the included license file.

Original author of ECM: **BttrDrgn**.

## Requirements

- Windows
- Need for Speed: Underground 2
- A working ASI loading setup or a compatible mod manager
- Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable (x86): https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x86.exe

## Building

Build instructions for generating the plugin are available in [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md).

## Installation

### Option 1: Mr. Modman

If you use [Mr. Modman](https://github.com/VelocityCL/mr.modman):

1. Extract the files from the `scripts` folder into your game's global directory or pack directory.
2. Make sure `ecm-r.x86.asi` is included.
3. Download `bass.dll` from the official BASS website: https://www.un4seen.com/
4. Place `bass.dll` in the same `scripts` folder as ECM-R.
5. Make sure `ecm-r.x86.ini` is present or allow ECM-R to create it on first launch.
6. Create a folder named `Music` next to the mod files.
7. Put your songs inside that folder.

### Option 2: ASI Loader

If your game already uses an ASI loader such as `dinput8.dll`:

1. Extract the release files into the game directory.
2. Make sure `ecm-r.x86.asi` is present.
3. Download `bass.dll` from the official BASS website: https://www.un4seen.com/
4. Place `bass.dll` in the same `scripts` folder as ECM-R.
5. Make sure `ecm-r.x86.ini` is present or allow ECM-R to create it on first launch.
6. Create a `Music` folder in the expected mod location.
7. Put your songs inside that folder.

## Supported Audio Formats

ECM-R currently scans the playlist folder for these file types:

- `.wav`
- `.mp1`
- `.mp2`
- `.mp3`
- `.ogg`
- `.aif`

## How It Works

- ECM-R loads music from the configured playlist folder.
- The game's own music volume is muted by the mod.
- Songs are shuffled automatically.
- When a track ends, the next one is played.
- Songs can be tagged for frontend-only or in-game-only playback through the configuration file.
- Music can be stopped automatically during loading screens to better match the game's original behavior.
- Shuffle and repeat playback behavior can be changed from the overlay or configuration file.

If a filename follows the format `Artist - Title.ext`, the overlay chyron uses that information when possible.

## Controls

- `F11`: Toggle the in-game overlay by default
- `F9`: Go back to the previous song by default
- `F10`: Skip to the next song by default

Both hotkeys can be changed in `ecm-r.x86.ini`.

## Overlay

The overlay provides:

- An **Actions** menu
  - Volume slider
  - Previous button
  - Skip button
  - Shuffle toggle
  - Repeat toggle
- A **Playlist** menu
  - Displays the discovered songs
- A status line showing the current song and playlist name

## Configuration

ECM-R creates a configuration file automatically on first launch:

- `ecm-r.x86.ini`

Default configuration:

```ini
[core]
playlist = "Music"
volume = "100"
version = "..."

[config]
shuffle_enabled = true
repeat_enabled = true
stop_music_on_loading_screens = true

[keys]
toggle_overlay = F11
previous_track = F9
skip_track = F10

[trax]
song1.mp3 = ALL
song2.mp3 = FE
song3.mp3 = IG
```

### Core Settings

- `playlist`: Folder name used as the music library. Default is `Music`.
- `volume`: Playback volume from `0` to `100`.
- `version`: Internal version marker used by the mod.

### Config Settings

- `shuffle_enabled`: Controls whether valid tracks are shuffled before playback. Default is `true`.
- `repeat_enabled`: Controls whether playback restarts from the beginning of the valid track list after the last song finishes. Default is `true`.
- `stop_music_on_loading_screens`: Controls whether ECM-R stops the current song during loading screens before starting another song after loading. Default is `true`.

Accepted values include `true`, `false`, `1`, `0`, `yes`, `no`, `on`, and `off`.

If `shuffle_enabled` is set to `false`, ECM-R plays valid tracks in their discovered order.
If `repeat_enabled` is set to `false`, playback stops after the last valid track in the current context.

### Key Bindings

- `toggle_overlay`: Key used to show or hide the overlay.
- `previous_track`: Key used to go back to the previous song.
- `skip_track`: Key used to jump to the next song.

Supported values include:

- Function keys such as `F1` to `F24`
- Letters such as `A` to `Z`
- Digits such as `0` to `9`
- Named keys such as `Space`, `Tab`, `Enter`, `Escape`, `Insert`, `Delete`, `Home`, `End`, `PageUp`, `PageDown`, `Up`, `Down`, `Left`, and `Right`

### Track Routing

Each discovered song is added under `[trax]`.

Allowed values:

- `ALL`: Play everywhere
- `FE`: Frontend only
- `IG`: In-game only

This lets you separate menu music from racing music.

## Loading Screen Behavior

By default, ECM-R stops custom music during loading screens and starts another song when normal frontend or in-game playback resumes.

This behavior is controlled by:

```ini
[config]
stop_music_on_loading_screens = true
```

Set it to `false` if you want custom music to continue following the older behavior.

## Playback Modes

ECM-R exposes shuffle and repeat controls in the overlay and stores their values in `ecm-r.x86.ini`.

```ini
[config]
shuffle_enabled = true
repeat_enabled = true
```

- Set `shuffle_enabled = false` for sequential playback.
- Set `repeat_enabled = false` to stop playback after the last valid track.
- Changes made from the overlay are saved back to the configuration file automatically.

## Playlist Folder

By default, ECM-R looks for a folder named `Music` relative to the mod location.

Example:

```text
Game Folder/
  scripts/
    ecm-r.x86.asi
    ecm-r.x86.ini
    bass.dll
    Music/
      Artist - Song 01.mp3
      Artist - Song 02.ogg
```

## Planned Features

The following features are planned for future releases:

- **Pause/Resume Control** - Persistent pause state that maintains playback position
- **Multiple Playlists** - Switch between different music folders dynamically within the game
- **Advanced Context Filters** - More granular playback rules beyond FE/IG (events, game modes, etc.)
- **Context-Based Volume Control** - Different volume levels for frontend and in-game music
- **Lip-Sync Synchronization** - Adjust audio synchronization for cutscenes and cinematics
- **Volume Normalization** - Automatic level equalization across all tracks
- **Real-Time Audio Format Conversion** - Support for additional audio formats through runtime conversion

## Notes

- If `bass.dll` is missing or the wrong version is loaded, audio playback will fail.
- This project loads the official BASS runtime dynamically and requires `bass.dll` at runtime.
- Download `bass.dll` from the official BASS website: https://www.un4seen.com/
- Place `bass.dll` in the same `scripts` folder as ECM-R runtime files.
- The current runtime integration has been tested with BASS `v2.4.18.11`.
- BASS is a third-party library and remains subject to the official BASS license terms.
- ECM-R does not bundle or redistribute `bass.dll`; users must obtain the official runtime themselves.
- ECM-R is maintained as a non-commercial fork project.
- If your usage of ECM-R or BASS becomes commercial, review the official BASS licensing terms and obtain any required licence before distribution.
- The mod writes a crash dump file on unhandled exceptions.
- This repository includes third-party dependencies and keeps the original MIT license notice.
- The fork branding is ECM-R, and the runtime filenames follow the `ecm-r.*` naming scheme.
