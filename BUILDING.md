# Building ECM-R

## Overview

This repository does **not** build the ECM-R game plugin through CMake.
The `.asi` module is generated from a Premake script located at `lua/windows.lua`, and project files are created with `generate.bat`.

For **Need for Speed: Underground 2**, the relevant target is the **32-bit** build.

## Requirements

- Windows
- Git
- Visual Studio with C++ desktop build tools
- MSVC **v143** toolset (the generated projects target Visual Studio 2022 tools by default)
- A Windows SDK installed through Visual Studio

### Repository-managed dependencies

This repository already includes or references the main dependencies needed for compilation:

- `tools/premake5.exe`
- `deps/bass`
- `deps/freetype-2.12.1`
- Git submodules:
  - `deps/imgui`
  - `deps/ini_rw`
  - `deps/minhook`
  - `deps/kiero`

## 1. Clone the repository

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/RCompanyX/ecm-r.git
cd ecm-r
```

If the repository was already cloned without submodules, initialize them before generating the solution:

```powershell
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## 2. Generate the Visual Studio solution

From the repository root, run:

```powershell
.\generate.bat
```

This does two things:

1. Updates the required submodules.
2. Generates `build/ECM-R.sln` using `tools/premake5.exe` and `lua/windows.lua`.

## 3. Build the plugin in Visual Studio

1. Open `build/ECM-R.sln`.
2. Select the solution configuration:
   - `Release`
3. Select the solution platform:
   - `Win-x86`
4. Build the `Overlay` project, or build the full solution.

### Expected output

For the 32-bit release build, the generated files are placed in:

- `build/bin/Release-Win-x86/x86/ecm.x86.dll`
- `build/bin/Release-Win-x86/x86/ecm.x86.asi`
- `build/bin/Release-Win-x86/x86/bass.dll`

## 4. Runtime package

The build produces the DLL and also creates an `.asi` copy during post-build.

The final runtime package should include at least:

- `ecm.x86.asi`
- `bass.dll`

## 5. Optional command-line build

After generating the solution, the 32-bit release target can also be built with MSBuild:

```powershell
msbuild build\ECM-R.sln /t:Overlay /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=Win-x86 /m
```

## 6. Install into the game

Copy the runtime files into the location used by your ASI loader or mod manager.
For a typical setup, this means placing:

- `ecm.x86.asi`
- `bass.dll`

next to the game executable or inside the mod loader's expected scripts directory.

Then create a `Music` folder in the expected mod location and place the audio files there.

## Troubleshooting

### MSB8020: Visual Studio 2022 build tools not found

If the build reports that toolset `v143` is missing, install the Visual Studio 2022 C++ build tools.
The generated solution currently targets `v143` by default.

If a newer Visual Studio version is installed, it can still open the solution, but `v143` must be available unless the projects are manually retargeted.

### CMake cannot build the plugin

Even if the workspace is opened as a CMake-capable folder, the plugin itself is not configured through a top-level `CMakeLists.txt`.
Use `generate.bat` and the generated Visual Studio solution instead.

### Missing third-party code

If directories such as `deps/imgui` or `deps/minhook` are empty, run:

```powershell
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Wrong architecture

`Need for Speed: Underground 2` uses the 32-bit plugin.
Build and deploy `Release | Win-x86` unless you are targeting a different loader or a separate 64-bit environment.

## Branding note

ECM-R is a fork of the original ECM project by **BttrDrgn**.
The repository branding has been updated to ECM-R, but the runtime filenames currently remain `ecm.x86.asi` and `ecm.x86.ini` for compatibility.
